# Pokedex
This is a project created using React. You may search any Pokemon by name or Pokedex number. Also the original 150 Pokemon are on display in the Pokedex.

Future updates will include:
- A like system.
- A sort view system.
- Page tabs for different generations so you can see the entire Pokedex.
- An interactive catch system and a visual update to show what Pokemon you have caught.
